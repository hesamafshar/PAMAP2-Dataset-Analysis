# üìÅ PAMAP2-Dataset-Analysis

## üìù Description
This project performs an exploratory analysis and basic preprocessing on the **PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring Dataset**, which includes multimodal sensor data collected from different body parts during various physical activities. The purpose of this notebook is to clean, visualize, and analyze the data to build a foundation for future classification and activity recognition tasks.

## üìì Notebook Workflow Summary

### `PAMAP2-Dataset-Analysis.ipynb`

This Jupyter notebook includes the following stages:

1. **Importing Required Libraries**
   - `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, etc., are imported for data manipulation and visualization.

2. **Activity Mapping**
   - Activity codes in the dataset are mapped to human-readable labels such as `'sitting'`, `'walking'`, `'cycling'`, etc.

3. **Understanding MET Categories**
   - Activities are grouped by intensity (e.g., light, moderate, vigorous) using their **MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task)** values from the dataset documentation.

4. **Loading and Merging Raw Data**
   - Sensor data files are loaded and merged into a single unified DataFrame for ease of processing.

5. **Data Cleaning**
   - Redundant columns such as invalid orientation measurements and over-saturated accelerometer readings are identified and dropped.

6. **Missing Values Handling**
   - NaN values, mostly found in heart rate readings, are imputed or discarded as necessary.

7. **Feature Scaling**
   - Features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to make them suitable for downstream ML tasks.

8. **Data Segmentation**
   - Windowing strategies are introduced (but not fully implemented in this version) for future time-series modeling.

9. **Visualization**
   - Heatmaps of feature correlations and line plots are used to understand the relationship and variance between different sensor signals.
